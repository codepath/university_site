<h2>What is the Practical iOS Development Course?</h2>
<p>
The Practical iOS Course for University is an on-campus program built from the same curriculum we use to train professional engineers on-site at Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, Lyft and many other Silicon Valley companies. Like all CodePath courses, this course uses a project based, hands-on approach to introduce students to mobile development. Video demos and lectures presented by CodePath Instructors, along with CodePath's open source iOS guides, give students the foundation needed to jump right in and start building iOS apps from day one. Along with weekly projects and labs, students work in small teams to apply what they've learned through the design and development of an original app from the ground up. The course culminates in a Demo Day event where teams present their apps to fellow students, faculty and local industry professionals. By the end of the course, students have added significantly to their portfolios and gained real experience in sprint planning and other industry standard work-flows.<br>

</p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">What is the Facebook Web Security course?</h2>
<p>
The Web Application Security Course is an on-campus program that will focus on teaching University students the mindset of a security professional along with the fundamentals of web security, common application vulnerabilities, and hands-on practice focused on developing defensive applications. The curriculum was developed in partnership with Facebook and covers standard security fundamentals. Topics will be introduced with a combination of sessions, videos, projects, and labs. The course will also introduce web application development with the LAMP stack including PHP and MySQL to provide a context for exploring web security.<br>

<div class='questions'>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>COMMON QUESTIONS</b>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Who can apply?</h3>
<p>
This application is open to undergraduate university students who are comfortable 
with basic programming, data structures and algorithms.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>What is the cost?</h3>
<p>The class is free for students. We work closely with a number of partners who help us cover the costs of the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>What does the application process look like?</h3>
<p>
Fill out our short application 
<a href='https://goo.gl/c8YTWE'>for iOS</a> or
<a href='https://goo.gl/YLWk9k'>for Web Security</a>
and you will receive instructions to complete a Pre-Work video tutorial by December 30th.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>What is the affiliation with my school?</h3>
<p>CodePath is not affiliated with or funded by any university.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>How can I increase my changes of getting in?</h3>
<p><b>Apply to become a TA</b> on your campus. The TAs are students who take the class but also ensure it happens in the first place. While applying to the program, you'll see a link to apply as a TA instead of a regular student.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>How are students selected?</h3>
<p>
We select based on submissions from our application process. We look for highly dedicated students who are excited to spend the necessary time 
to keep up with our weekly assignments and sessions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>What support do you provide?</h3>
<p>We find that our program is most empowering and impactful when it’s student-led. The CodePath staff will carefully select and mentor a group of student leaders (TAs) who will help facilitate a class of students. We have created and tested extensive learning materials including pre-recorded video lectures and online documentation to help with the homework. In addition, our staff and alumni community will be available to answer student questions online about lecture materials as well as the homework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>How much time will this class take?</h3>
<p>
You should set aside 5-10 hours per week for this class. This includes 1 session per week (2 hours) and homework (4-8 hours). 
The class will last 12 weeks. For universities on the Quarter system, the course will overlap between Winter and Spring quarters. No mandatory sessions will be held over Spring Break.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Will I get any credit?</h3>
<p>
We are working with universities to provide our courses for credit as they are currently at Purdue University.
We need a CS professor to sponsor the class in order to offer our programs for credit. If you can help, reach out to us at
<a href='mailto:university@codepath.com'>university@codepath.com</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>What is the role of a Student Lead ("TA") ?</h3>
<p>The TAs are students who take the class but also ensure it happens in the first place. Your role is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Recruit a diverse set of students who are motivated to learn web security or mobile app development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manage logistics for the class and weekly sessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Track attendance, homework submissions, as well as student feedback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organize a Demo Day event for student to showcase their final group-projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>At each university, we typically have 2-3 TAs for every 20 students. TAs rotate and manage the class. Become the one who helps bring this opportunity to your fellow classmates!</p>
</br>
</li>
<li>
<h3>What is the time commitment for a TA?</h3>
<p>The commitment for student leaders is 12-20 hours per week including taking the class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>What are the incentives for TAs?</h3>
<p>You get a chance to develop strong leadership skills while benefiting from mentorship from our staff and alumni who are top engineers and designers in the industry.</p>
